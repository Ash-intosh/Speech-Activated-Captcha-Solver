## How to Run the Code

Follow these steps to set up and run the captcha solver:

1. **Ensure File Structure**: Keep all files and folders in the same directory structure as provided.

2. **Install Node.js**: 
   - For macOS:  
     ```bash
     brew install node
     ```
   - For other operating systems, download and install Node.js from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).

3. **Install Dependencies**:  
   Install the required dependencies by running:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   Make sure the dependencies listed in the `requirement.txt` file are installed.

4. **Start the Backend Server**:  
   Run the server file using Node.js:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

5. **Access the Webpage**:  
   Open a Chrome browser and go to the following URL:  
   [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

6. Your captcha solver is now ready to use!

## How It Works

1. **Mathematical Captcha**:  
   The webpage displays a captcha in the form of a simple mathematical equation.

2. **Voice Input**:  
   - The user clicks the **"Recording"** button and verbally says the answer to the captcha.
   - The voice input is recorded and sent to the backend server.

3. **Backend Processing**:  
   - The backend server processes the audio input.
   - The HMM model (using the predictor) analyzes the audio and predicts the word.

4. **Validation**:  
   - If the predicted answer matches the correct solution, the user is taken to the next page.

## Dependencies

Ensure the following are installed:

- **Node.js** (v14 or higher)
- **npm** (Node Package Manager)
- Dependencies listed in `requirement.txt`

To install dependencies, run:  
```bash
npm install
```

---

## Notes

1. If any changes are made in the `hmm` folder (e.g., modifying `hmm.cpp` or retraining the model), recompile the code to create the binary file:
   - Save the binary file with the same name `hmm`.

2. Use **Google Chrome** for the best experience.
